# Twig Translation Extension

A Twig Translation Extension.  
This twig extension was forked from [Odan/Twig-Translation](https://github.com/odan/twig-translation) because I wanted more flexibility with available methods for translating.  
So, this extension uses [Delight-im/i18n](https://github.com/delight-im/PHP-I18N) to handle the translations. 

## Requirements

* PHP 7.4

## Installation

```
composer require darkalchemy/twig-translation
```

## Integration

### Register the Twig Extension
